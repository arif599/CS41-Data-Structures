# CS 41 Data Structures
Instructor: Glenn Cuevas (gcuevas@ivc.edu)

## Course Description:
This course covers the basic concepts of data structures and related algorithms. Topics
include arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs and tables. These topics will be
used to develop complete programs. Recursion, searching, sorting, as well as time and
space analysis for related algorithms will be discussed.

## Course Learning Objectives:
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to develop algorithms that make use
of the data structures covered in class, understand how to analyze the time and space
needs of algorithms. You will also be capable of building complete programs to
implement these algorithms with the appropriate data structures.

1. Link Based Stack: Students will create a program that creates a link based
stack.
2. Multiple Linked Structure: Students will create a program that utilizes a
multiple linked structure.
3. Binary Search Tree: Students will create a binary search tree program that
incorporates creation of the tree and several common tree operations.
4. Hash Table Chain Collision Resolution: Students will create a hash table
program that implements quick data access utilizing chaining collision resolution.


## Course Prerequisites:
